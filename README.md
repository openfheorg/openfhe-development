OpenFHE - Open-Source Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library
=====================================

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful cryptographic primitive that enables performing computations over encrypted data without having access to the secret key.
OpenFHE is an open-source FHE library that includes efficient implementations of all common FHE schemes:
  * Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme for integer arithmetic
  * Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme for integer arithmetic
  * Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme for real-number arithmetic (includes approximate bootstrapping)
  * Ducas-Micciancio (DM) and Chillotti-Gama-Georgieva-Izabachene (CGGI) schemes for Boolean circuit evaluation

OpenFHE also includes the following multiparty extensions of FHE:
  * Threshold FHE for BGV, BFV, and CKKS schemes
  * Proxy Re-Encryption for BGV, BFV, and CKKS schemes
