OpenFHE - Open-Source Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library
=====================================

OpenFHE is an open-source fully homomorphic encryption library that currently includes efficient implementations of the following lattice cryptography capabilities:

* Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)
  * Brakerski/Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme for integer arithmetic
  * Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) scheme for integer arithmetic
  * Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) scheme for real-number arithmetic
  * Ducas-Micciancio (FHEW) and Chillotti-Gama-Georgieva-Izabachene (TFHE) schemes for Boolean circuit evaluation
* Multi-Party Extensions of FHE (to support multi-key FHE)
  * Threshold FHE for BGV, BFV, and CKKS schemes
  * Proxy Re-Encryption for BGV, BFV, and CKKS schemes
