/*
  This code provides generation of gaussian distributions of discrete values. Discrete uniform generator
  relies on the built-in C++ generator for 32-bit unsigned integers defined in <random>
 */

/*This is the header file for the Generic Sampler used for various Discrete
 * Gaussian Sampling applications. This class implements the generic sampler by
 * UCSD discussed in the https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/259.pdf and it is heavily
 * based on Michael Walter's original code. Along the sides of the
 * implementation there are also two different "base samplers", which are used
 * for the generic sampler or can be used on their own depending on the
 * requirements of needed application.
 *
 * The first base sampler uses Peikert's inversion method, discussed in
 * section 4.1 of https://eprint.iacr.org/2010/088.pdf and summarized in
 * section 3.2.2 of
 * https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00200-014-0218-3.pdf.
 * Peikert's method requires precomputation of CDF tables around a specific
 * center and the table must be kept during the sampling process. Hence,
 * Peikert's method works best if the DESIRED STANDARD DEVIATION IS SMALL and
 * THE MEAN OF THE DISTRIBUTION IS FIXED, as each new center will require a new
 * set of precomputations.
 *
 * Second base sampler is  the Knuth-Yao Sampler discussed in section 5 of
 * https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00200-014-0218-3.pdf .
 * Similar to Peikert's, Knuth-Yao precomputes the PDF's of the numbers based on
 * standard deviation and the center, which is used during the sampling process.
 * Therefore like Peikert's method,  Knuth-Yao works best method works best if
 * the DESIRED STANDARD DEVIATION IS SMALL and THE MEAN OF THE DISTRIBUTION IS
 * FIXED, as each new center will require a new set of precomputations, just
 * like Peikert's inversion method.
 *
 * The "generic sampler" on the other hand, works independent from standard
 * deviation of the distribution. It combines an array of previously discussed
 * base samplers centered around 0 to (2^b-1) / 2^b through convolution. The
 * tables of base samplers however, must be precomputed beforehand; but they do
 * not need to be recalculated at any time of the sampling process. It is USABLE
 * FOR ANY STANDARD DEVIATION AND MEAN, just like Karney's method defined in
 * discretegaussiangenerator.h, needs only one single precomputation and is not
 * prone to timing attacks unlike Karney. Karney's method, however, is faster
 * than the generic sampler.
 *
 * PARAMETER SELECTION FOR GENERIC SAMPLER
 *
 * The selection of parameters change the run time/memory usage/precision of the
 * generic sampler. The triple trade off between these parameters are defined in
 * the equation k = (PRECISION - FLIPS) / LOG_BASE. k denotes the level of
 * precision of the generic sampler. Higher the k is, higher the precision of
 * the generic sampler but higher the run time. PRECISION denotes the number of
 * decimal bits in the center of the distribution. Since we are using 'double'
 * for mean, it is fixed to 53 by definition. FLIPS denote the number of
 * Bernoulli flips used to approximate the bits used in combination of base
 * sampler. Higher the number of flips, larger the number of bits approximated
 * rather than calculated which means smaller run times. Generic sampler
 * requires a set of base samplers centered around 0/2^b to (2^b-1)/2^b;
 * LOG_BASE denotes b in this equation. Higher the LOG_BASE is, more base
 * samplers required which requires additional memory; but at the same time
 * smaller run times.
 *
 * The base samplers used in generic sampler requires varying centers between
 * 0/2^b and (2^b-1)/(2^b) with the same standard deviation. The standard
 * deviation required for base samplers must satisfy SIGMA>=4*SQRT(2)*N, where
 * sigma is the standard deviation of the base sampler and N is the smoothing
 * parameter
 *
