  /* A1) Multiplicative depth:
   * The CKKS scheme we setup here will work for any computation
   * that has a multiplicative depth equal to 'multDepth'.
   * This is the maximum possible depth of a given multiplication,
   * but not the total number of multiplications supported by the
   * scheme.
   *
   * For example, computation f(x, y) = x^2 + x*y + y^2 + x + y has
   * a multiplicative depth of 1, but requires a total of 3 multiplications.
   * On the other hand, computation g(x_i) = x1*x2*x3*x4 can be implemented
   * either as a computation of multiplicative depth 3 as
   * g(x_i) = ((x1*x2)*x3)*x4, or as a computation of multiplicative depth 2
   * as g(x_i) = (x1*x2)*(x3*x4).
   *
   * For performance reasons, it's generally preferable to perform operations
   * in the shorted multiplicative depth possible.
   */

  /* A2) Bit-length of scaling factor.
   * CKKS works for real numbers, but these numbers are encoded as integers.
   * For instance, real number m=0.01 is encoded as m'=round(m*D), where D is
   * a scheme parameter called scaling factor. Suppose D=1000, then m' is 10 (an
   * integer). Say the result of a computation based on m' is 130, then at
   * decryption, the scaling factor is removed so the user is presented with
   * the real number result of 0.13.
   *
   * Parameter 'scaleFactorBits' determines the bit-length of the scaling
   * factor D, but not the scaling factor itself. The latter is implementation
   * specific, and it may also vary between ciphertexts in certain versions of
   * CKKS (e.g., in EXACTRESCALE).
   *
   * Choosing 'scaleFactorBits' depends on the desired accuracy of the
   * computation, as well as the remaining parameters like multDepth or security
   * standard. This is because the remaining parameters determine how much noise
   * will be incurred during the computation (remember CKKS is an approximate
   * scheme that incurs small amounts of noise with every operation). The
   * scaling factor should be large enough to both accommodate this noise and
   * support results that match the desired accuracy.
   */

  /* A3) Number of plaintext slots used in the ciphertext.
   * CKKS packs multiple plaintext values in each ciphertext.
   * The maximum number of slots depends on a security parameter called ring
   * dimension. In this instance, we don't specify the ring dimension directly,
   * but let the library choose it for us, based on the security level we
   * choose, the multiplicative depth we want to support, and the scaling factor
   * size.
   *
   * Please use method GetRingDimension() to find out the exact ring dimension
   * being used for these parameters. Give ring dimension N, the maximum batch
   * size is N/2, because of the way CKKS works.
   */
  uint32_t batchSize = 8;

  /* A4) Desired security level based on FHE standards.
   * This parameter can take four values. Three of the possible values
   * correspond to 128-bit, 192-bit, and 256-bit security, and the fourth value
   * corresponds to "NotSet", which means that the user is responsible for
   * choosing security parameters. Naturally, "NotSet" should be used only in
   * non-production environments, or by experts who understand the security
   * implications of their choices.
   *
   * If a given security level is selected, the library will consult the current
   * security parameter tables defined by the FHE standards consortium
   * (https://homomorphicencryption.org/introduction/) to automatically
   * select the security parameters. Please see "TABLES of RECOMMENDED
   * PARAMETERS" in  the following reference for more details:

   * CKKS supports rotating the contents of a packed ciphertext, but to do so,

   * following call, which takes as input a vector with indices that correspond
   * to the rotation offset we want to support. Negative indices correspond to
   * right shift and positive to left shift. Look at the output of this demo for
   * an illustration of this.
   *
   * Keep in mind that rotations work on the entire ring dimension, not the
   * specified batch size. This means that, if ring dimension is 8 and batch
   * size is 4, then an input (1,2,3,4,0,0,0,0) rotated by 2 will become
   * (3,4,0,0,0,0,1,2) and not (3,4,1,2,0,0,0,0). Also, as someone can observe
   * in the output of this demo, since CKKS is approximate, zeros are not exact
   * - they're just very small numbers.
